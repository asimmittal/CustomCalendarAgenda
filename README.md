Switch to this directory, then:
```
npm install
npm run start
```

This will start the server on the first available port. The selected PORT_NUMBER will be logged in the console.
Open your browser, and go to:
```
http://localhost:PORT_NUMBER
```

This will launch a sample implementation. All you need to use this is in the public directory.
